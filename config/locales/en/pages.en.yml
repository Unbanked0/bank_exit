      body:
        - The digital €uro "Cash+" is a project of the <abbr title="European Central Bank">ECB</abbr> intended for use by European Union countries.
        - The Collective warns that this project appears to aim to eliminate the last exchanges of physical currency, thus allowing authorities total surveillance of financial transactions. This could be a step towards the establishment of a single, state-controlled payment system (dystopia).
        - The preparation phase is scheduled to end in October 2025, with a planned launch before 2030.

      description_html: |
        <p>We are a group of resilient citizens that formed around May 2022. We are freedom-loving and also experts on the subject of free and resilient cryptocurrencies (only 0.1% of 'cryptos').</p>

        <p>We are divided into %{local_groups_link} and informal groups in France, where everyone can meet and help each other on resilience issues, particularly <strong>Monero</strong> (XMR), <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (XBT/BTC), and <strong>June</strong> (G1). To date, half of the members of the collective are over 50.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to offer an alternative to the digital euro and protect our money, as well as that of as many French people as possible. The priority is therefore to <strong>protect</strong> our assets from various risks (bankruns, financial crises like in 2008, seizures by authorities, CBDCs, etc.), while <strong>maintaining</strong> our purchasing power.</p>

    - answer: <b>KYC</b> (<i>Know Your Customer</i>) is a process used by financial institutions, banks, payment companies, and other financial services to verify the identity of their customers. This process typically involves collecting documents such as identification cards, proof of address, and personal information to ensure transactions are legitimate and that customers are not involved in fraudulent or criminal activities.

- question: What is the difference between the map and the directory?
  content:
    - answer:
        - The map lists merchants with precise geolocation (latitude and longitude).
        - The directory lists businesses that don't have a specific address, either because they want to remain anonymous or because the service is available for delivery to an entire area or country. For example, an alternative media outlet or an online business.

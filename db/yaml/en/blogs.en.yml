    - title: Introduction
      body:
        - The digital euro "Cash+" is a European Central Bank (ECB) project aimed at improving digital banking services and simplifying payments across Europe.
        - This project aims to create a universal, secure, and easy-to-use system that will allow citizens to access their accounts and make financial transactions online, even without an internet connection or in rural areas.
        - The idea is to make payments more seamless and less expensive for people, while ensuring the security and confidentiality of financial information.
        - The preparation phase is scheduled to be completed by October 2025, with a planned launch before 2030.

    - title: Warnings ⚠️
      body:
        - "- <strong>Loss of Privacy</strong>: The widespread use of digital accounts and electronic payments could lead to increased surveillance and the collection of personal data by authorities and businesses."
        - "- <strong>Power Imbalance</strong>: A single, universally accepted currency could give too much power to financial institutions and the government, potentially leading to restrictive political decisions that are contrary to the public interest."
        - "- <strong>Access Issues</strong>: Populations without access to the internet or digital technologies could be excluded from digital currencies, leading to financial and social segregation."
        - "- <strong>Cyber Risk and Vulnerability</strong>: The widespread use of a digital system could expose users to significant cybersecurity risks, such as phishing attacks, market volatility, or even extortion."
        - "- <strong>Overreliance on technology</strong>: An economy that relies on a digital system could be vulnerable to technical disruptions and network outages."

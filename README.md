## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby >= 3.4.4**  
  Recommended installation method: [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/ruby.html) — a minimal, fast, and dependable Ruby installer.  
  See the official Rails guide for details: [Installing Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html#installing-ruby)

- **SQLite 3**

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Unbanked0/bank_exit
$ cd bank_exit

$ bin/setup
```

> [!TIP]
> Website is now ready to be accessed at http://localhost:3000 ! 🎉

To initially populate the database with merchants data, run the command in a Rails console:

```
❯ bin/rails console
bank-exit(dev)> FetchMerchants.call
```

> [!WARNING]
> This process would take few hours because an individual geocoding call is involved for each row to get the country code.  
> To speed up process, comment the `Merchants::AssignCountry.call` in the [FetchMerchants](app/services/fetch_merchants.rb) service to skip the country data.

## 💻 Available Commands

- `bin/dev` – Start processes defined in [Procfile](Procfile) (web and css)
- `bin/rails server` – Start the Rails server only
- `bin/rails db:migrate` – Run migrations to database
- `bin/rails sitemap:refresh:no_ping` – Regenerate the sitemap
- `bundle exec chusaku` – Annotate Rails controllers with route info

## 🏪 Merchant Data

Merchant data that populate the map are retrieved dynamically from the [Overpass](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) API.

A recurring task, managed by [SolidQueue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue#recurring-tasks), runs every 6 hours to automatically refresh merchants data.
A manual refresh button is still possible in the `maps#index` page.

## 🧭 Map Routing

Itinerary is calculated by the [OSRM Routing API](https://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.5.1/api) that detects the fastest way by car.

Adresses autocomplete are fetched from the Nominatim API through the [geocoder gem](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder).
